## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

We are sincerely requesting a funding grant from the web3 Foundation to build a transaction firewall that will function as a last resort security barrier when all user asset protection solutions fail. There have been several serious security incidents recently, including major asset losses due to the theft of private keys on the harmony and Robin bridges. In the blockchain world, having a helper or private key for an account is equivalent to getting ownership of that address; when a hacker obtains a user's helper or private key, he or she is able to take all the assets in a short period of time without any problem, a situation that obviously should not exist all the time. When this problem is not solved or alleviated, the Web3 world is full of uneasiness and suspicion, and this situation will make it difficult for the Web3 world to gain larger scale support and popularity.

The Redstone Network is a network of trigger circuits where users combine and arrange simple atomic trigger components according to certain rules and processes to eventually implement a series of automated operational circuits. We propose transaction firewall middleware that can function between any blockchain network, regardless of the cross-chain mechanism and network topology used to execute asset transfers, and regardless of the type of assets traded, we will construct a firewall of different security levels for users. With the help of triggers and machine learning technologies, we will provide users with passive defense and proactive alerting capabilities.

We will work with parallel chains in Polkadot/Kusama to build and deploy the firewall module to enable a higher level of security for parallel chain asset interactions within the ecosystem; in addition, we can work with project parties or wallets in other ecosystems to provide them with this unique defense mechanism, ultimately reducing the risk of asset security across the Web3 world.


### Project Details

For the transaction firewall functionality, Redstone Network will build a set of on-chain/off-chain trigger components and their implementations. In general, users will not be aware of the firewall's operation, and the firewall will truthfully notify users of potential security risks when there are triggered alarms on the chain.

#### Passive defense and active alarms
* We build a series of stateless atomic trigger components, including on-chain triggers (quantity trigger, time trigger, price trigger), off-chain triggers (mail trigger, discord trigger, slack trigger) and off-chain message interaction components, which are responsible for actively obtaining external information or pushing messages to a specified server.; 
* Analyze transaction characteristics and behavior, design transaction protocol analyze the transaction characteristics and behavior, design the transaction protocol, check whether the basic information and check information of the transaction match through protocol parsing, and initially determine the validity of the transaction; 
* according to the trigger and the transaction protocol, with the idea of social recovery and multiple signatures, formulate different security level trigger policies for users, including power grabbing mechanism, freezing mechanism and alarm mechanism.

#### Intelligent termination of transactions with evil address monitoring
The user-configured security scheme can effectively defend against known security problems, but not against unknown or unconfigured behaviors. By analyzing the transaction data recorded in the database under the chain, the transactions are analyzed according to the dimensions of transaction time, transaction frequency, transaction address, transaction direction, and transaction amount, and if the transaction behavior is different from the daily behavior, the meltdown mechanism will be triggered and alarmed; receiving the supervision instruction from a chain, the address that is doing evil and the derived address will be dynamically analyzed and the transaction meltdown mechanism will be triggered.

For the application scenario of transaction firewall, it is mainly divided into token assets and NFT assets. Users can choose the type of asset that needs to be configured with the firewall, either for a certain token, or to protect the account that issues NFT assets.

**Technology stack**
* Rust, Substrate
* Go, node.js

### Ecosystem Fit
This project will be developed, deployed and run based on the Substrate framework. Unlike other trigger projects, with the advanced features of OCW, we are able to provide users with an advanced on-chain alert push mechanism, which will help shorten the time for users to get critical information. At the same time, rooted in Polkadot/Kasuma ecology, as a parallel chain, the trigger interface on it will provide additional application features for all parallel chains, and with the help of relay chains, it can facilitate unique transaction defense capabilities for other parallel chains. We note that we are entering a completely new area that will provide an unprecedented protection experience for the blockchain space once our project is in actual operation.

## Future Plans

Conceptualizing the application with the trigger concept, implementing the transaction firewall first, and refining our design based on user feedback.
Implementation steps.
* develop on-chain/off-chain triggers for firewall requirements.
* refining the firewall design based on user feedback.
* implementing cross-chain transactions and providing transaction protection for cross-chain links.
* configure different levels of defense strategies based on implementation experience.
